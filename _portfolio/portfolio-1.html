        Accurate 3D reconstruction (MVS) often encounters significant challenges when dealing with textureless
        surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this master thesis, we assume that textureless areas are smooth and piecewise planar, we present
        a novel approach by leveraging plane segmentation (CNN) to improve to improve the accuracy
        and completeness of depth and normal map estimation, particularly in scenes where traditional
        photo-consistency-based methods fall short.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally; we evaluate our algorithm in terms of accuracy and completeness on the ETH-3D high
        resolution dataset.
