Accurate 3D reconstruction (MVS) often encounters significant challenges when dealing with textureless surfaces.

In this master's thesis, we assume that textureless areas are smooth and piecewise planar, we present a novel approach by leveraging plane segmentation (CNN) to improve to improve the accuracy and completeness of depth and normal map estimation, particularly in scenes where traditional photo-consistency-based methods fall short.

Finally; we evaluate our algorithm in terms of accuracy and completeness on the ETH-3D high
resolution dataset.
