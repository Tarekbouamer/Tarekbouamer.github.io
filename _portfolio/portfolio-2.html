        Abstract Multi-View Stereo (MVS)-based 3D reconstruction is a major topic in computer vision for
        which a vast number of methods have been proposed over the last decades showing impressive visual results.
        Long-since, benchmarks like Middlebury [45] numerically rank the individual methods considering
        accuracy and completeness as quality attributes. While the Middlebury benchmark provides low-resolution
        images only, the recently published ETH3D [44] and Tanks and Temples [23] benchmarks allow for an
        evaluation of high-resolution and large-scale MVS from natural camera configurations. This benchmarking
        reveals that still only few methods can be used for the reconstruction of large-scale models. We present
        an effective pipeline for large-scale 3D reconstruction which extends existing methods in several ways:
        (i) We introduce an outlier filtering considering the MVS geometry and make use of machine-learned
        confidences for filtering [30]. (ii) To avoid incomplete models from local matching methods we propose
        a plane completion method based on growing superpixels allowing a generic generation of high-quality 3D
        models. We show further improvements by utilizing plane detections from a deep neural network [33] in
        addition to superpixel segmentation masks to generate improved plane-based segmentation masks.
        (iii) Finally, we use deep learning for a subsequent filtering of outliers in segmented sky areas.
        We give experimental evidence on benchmarks that our contributions improve the quality of the 3D model
        and our method is state-of-the-art in high-quality 3D reconstruction from high-resolution images or
        large image sets.
