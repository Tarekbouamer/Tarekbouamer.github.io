        Safety is an emerging tasks in the field of Self-driving Cars that includes Perception,
        Planning and Decision Making fields to improve the autonomy in all driving conditions
        especially in the urban driving where the cars shares the environment with other vehicles and
        pedestrians. Several research activities has been done and some promising results were
        achieved.

        In this master thesis, we have focused on Trajectory planning and Execution task that
        enables our Amesim Car to overtake safely around predefined environment attempting to
        reduce the error between the planning and execution. A kinodynamic motion planner like-
        driver was developed to mimic the human driver actions and to provide us with an executable
        path.

        In addition, An optimal trajectory controller was designed to stabilize the vehicle and
        track perfectly the reference under system constraints. A simple and complete model of
        Amesim car was identified to be used in both path planning and controller design.

        Finally, a co-simulation is carried for different scenarios: double lane change test and
        racing track with different control schemes
