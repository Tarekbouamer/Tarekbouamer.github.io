Hello, I'm Tarek,

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Vision and Robotics from Paris Saclay University, France, and I've achieved distinction in my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics from INELEC, Boumerdes University, Algeria.

I worked as a Research Specialist at ATRC in Abu Dhabi, UAE, where I contributed to cutting-edge projects in visual positioning systems for UAVs and automated object detection and tracking.

Before this, I was a research assistant at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG) in Graz, Austria. Here, I concentrated on tackling challenges in 3D reconstruction and scene understanding. During this time, I had the privilege of interning and collaborating with distinguished professionals including Prof. Friedrich Fraundorfer, Dr. Horst Possegger, and Prof. Horst Bischof.

Research Interests:

- Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Visual Localization.
- 2D-3D feature matching and pose estimation.
- 3D reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting.
- Diffusion models and generative 3D techniques.

I am passionate about advancing technologies in computer vision, robotics, and machine learning to solve real-world challenges. My goal is to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications, pushing the boundaries of innovation in these fields.

_I am currently exploring research opportunities in computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. If you have any exciting projects or collaborations, feel free to reach out to me at [ [email] ](mailto: <tarekbouamer1788@gmail.com>)_
