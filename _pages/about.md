I received my bachelor's degree from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (ex.INELEC) , and my master's degree from Paris Saclay University in Computer Vision and Robotics.

I was an intern and research assistant at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG), TU-Graz where I focused on 3D Scene Reconstruction and Understanding.

I am interested in solving computer vision problems using Deep Learning, such as 3D Scene Reconstrution and Visual Localization.
