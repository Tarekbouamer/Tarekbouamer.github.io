Hi! Iâ€™m Tarek,

I have attained a Master's degree in Computer Vision and Robotics from Paris Saclay University, France. Prior to that, I excelled in my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics from INELEC, Boumerdes University, Algeria.

This diverse academic journey uniquely positions me to approach challenges from various angles and contribute innovatively at the intersection of these fields.

I have had the privilege of working as a research assistant at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG) in Graz, Austria, where I focused on addressing challenges related to 3D reconstruction and scene understanding. During this time, I had the invaluable opportunity to intern and collaborate with Prof. Friedrich Fraundorfer, Dr. Horst Possegger, and Prof. Horst Bischof.

My research interests revolve around leveraging optimization and learning methodologies to address intricate problems in computer vision, with a specific focus on 3D scene reconstruction and visual localization.
